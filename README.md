3. Open the project in Android Studio
4. Attach an emulator/an Android device to your system
5. Run the app
6. The app will launch on the selected emulator/device

Steps to test the app:-
1. Launch the app with internet ON. You will see few images on the screen.
2. Start scrolling down the list. You will see that the new images are being loaded smoothly.
3. Close the app.
4. Turn OFF the internet (Both mobile data and Wifi)
5. Launch the app again.
6. You will be able to see the images which were cached during the last launch.
7. Scroll down and at a stage you will be able to see the placeholder images. It means the data for those images couldn't be cached.
8. Turn on the internet and you will be able to see that the images for the placeholder images will start loading automatically.
